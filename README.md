# Privacy Tax Calculator - Confidential Tax Processing

A revolutionary privacy-preserving tax calculation system built on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology. Calculate your taxes without revealing your financial data to anyone.

## üîê Core Concept

The Privacy Tax Calculator leverages advanced cryptographic techniques to perform tax calculations while keeping your sensitive financial information completely private. Using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), all computations are performed on encrypted data, ensuring that:

- Your actual income amounts remain confidential
- Tax deductions are processed without exposure
- Only you can decrypt the final results
- All operations are verifiable on the blockchain

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üõ°Ô∏è Fully Encrypted Calculations**: All tax computations performed on encrypted data
- **üîí Zero Knowledge Architecture**: No one can see your actual financial information
- **‚õìÔ∏è Blockchain Verified**: All operations recorded on Sepolia testnet for transparency
- **üìä Progressive Tax Rates**: Accurate calculation with 10%, 20%, and 30% tax brackets
- **üíº Multiple Scenarios**: Pre-configured scenarios for different income levels
- **üéØ Custom Input Support**: Enter your own income and deduction amounts
- **üì± User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for seamless tax processing

## üí° How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet**: Link your MetaMask wallet to the Sepolia testnet
2. **Select Scenario**: Choose from predefined scenarios or enter custom amounts
3. **Submit Tax Info**: Your data is encrypted and submitted to the blockchain
4. **Calculate Tax**: Perform homomorphic calculations on encrypted data
5. **View Results**: Decrypt and view your tax calculation results
6. **Clear Records**: Optionally remove your data from the blockchain

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript with modern ES6+ features
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with dark theme and responsive design
- **Web3 Integration**: Ethers.js v6 for blockchain interactions
- **Wallet Support**: MetaMask integration with network switching

### Smart Contract
- **Language**: Solidity ^0.8.24
- **Network**: Sepolia Testnet
- **Features**: FHE simulation, event logging, access control

### Cryptography
- **Encryption**: Simulated Fully Homomorphic Encryption
- **Hashing**: Keccak-256 for data integrity
- **Proofs**: Cryptographic proof generation for encrypted values

## üìä Tax Calculation Logic

The system implements a progressive tax structure:

- **10% Tax Bracket**: Income up to $50,000
- **20% Tax Bracket**: Income from $50,001 to $100,000  
- **30% Tax Bracket**: Income above $100,000

### Example Calculations

**Low Income Scenario** ($30,000 income, $5,000 deductions):
- Taxable Income: $25,000
- Tax Owed: $2,500 (10% bracket)
- Effective Rate: 8.33%

**Medium Income Scenario** ($75,000 income, $12,000 deductions):
- Taxable Income: $63,000
- Tax Owed: $7,600 (mixed brackets)
- Effective Rate: 10.13%

**High Income Scenario** ($150,000 income, $25,000 deductions):
- Taxable Income: $125,000
- Tax Owed: $22,500 (all brackets)
- Effective Rate: 15.00%

## üîí Privacy Features

### Data Protection
- All financial data encrypted before blockchain submission
- Homomorphic calculations preserve privacy throughout processing
- Results only decryptable by the data owner
- No intermediate plaintext exposure
